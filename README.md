# RescueJpg
RescueJpg is atool to rescue missing jpeg in diskspace.  It can scan disk image and extract the image to another folder.

## Version
Current version is V0.2
RescueJpg can scan out the jpeg address and size from the disk image.  And extract the found image to a folder.

## Development
The next step is to recognize the EXIF for date filter.

## Application
The SONY RAW and Canon RAW also have a JPEG Image inside the RAW file.  Seems RescueJpg can find them out.
